A new Tower, that will push your limits. Classical hard jumps, combined with new gimmicks & refined old gimmicks will come along the journey. Those will be your obstacles, while you jump your way to the top in order to achieve immortality(+).

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Warning: Immortal Babe+ is a hard map with a difficulty similar to Immortal Babe.<br>If you did not enjoy Immortal Babe the chance is high you will not enjoy Immortal Babe+ either.</p>
    <p>Imagine, an epic story about a superbly difficult & challenging climb, that leads to a final tower; atop of that a Babe. Just like the other Babes she is smoking hot in her very own unique way, and you know that you want her. In order to reach her you must prove your immortal(+) resolve, as well as confirm your excellent jumping skills. Luckily for you, time won't run out since she is immortal(+).</p>
    <p>Sidenote: 0 fall runs are possible on this map. In theory Giant Boots and Boots+Ring is possible as well but I would advise against trying it.</p>
